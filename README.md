# didedoshka's nvim-config

My config for neovim.

## Goals

1. It should look and feel like vim, using vim workflow. It shouldn't be cluttered up with information and popups eveerywhere. 
2. I should understand every single line of lua config that's written



## Todo

1. Rewrite lsp keymaps to on_attach
2. Add lazygit
